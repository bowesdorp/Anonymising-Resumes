During my time in Edinburgh Napier University in pursue of my MBA course, I have made emphasis onto corporate law and governance where I have performed an in-depth research in relation to my professional qualification, ICSA. By doing this study, I have also conducted survey with top management levels and professors, for ways to improve best practices and proper internal control system within an organization. As a result, accounting loophole and fraud may be avoided, which in turn improves the economy by attracting new foreign investment due to transparency, and accountability.
